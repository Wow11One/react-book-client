# book-client
The application provides a client for a [book-rest-api](https://github.com/Wow11One/book-rest-api).
So, in order to test the app, it is required to start a server first.
In a 'pages/main' folder you can find a page that contains a book list.
In a 'pages/bookForm' folder you can find a page that contains a book form.
